   Interface that models an "access" to a variable. The variable can
   be either on the heap or on the stack (or in a register), but it is
   typically described by an offset from a base pointer. For variables
   in a record on the heap, the base pointer is normally a pointer to
   the first element in the record. For variables on the stack, the
   base pointer is normally the frame pointer, but outgoing parameters
   may be accessed relative to the stack pointer. This interface is
   independent of the target architecture, but it is designed for real
   processors. For virtual machines, use the @see VMAccess interface.
